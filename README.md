**Project Title**: Timely Webpage

**Description**: I developed a Timely webpage as a personal project to showcase my skills in web development, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The Timely webpage is a responsive and user-friendly website designed to display time-related information with a modern and visually appealing layout.

**Key Features**:

1.HTML and CSS: I used HTML to structure the content and CSS to style and format the webpage. This allowed for precise control over the design and layout of the page.

2.Bootstrap Framework: Leveraging the power of the Bootstrap framework, I ensured that the webpage is responsive and accessible on various devices and screen sizes. This responsive design approach enhances the user experience by adapting the layout to different screen dimensions.

3.Modern Design: I incorporated a clean and modern design with a user-friendly interface. The use of Bootstrap components and CSS styles made the webpage visually appealing and easy to navigate.

4.Responsive Design: I implemented responsive design principles to ensure that the webpage looks and functions seamlessly on desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. This mobile-friendly approach extends the reach of the webpage to a wider audience.

**Technologies Used**:
